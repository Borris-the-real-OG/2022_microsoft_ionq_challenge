_Quantum Emblem_
==========

*What is "Quantum Emblem"?*
---------------

Quantum Emblem is a turn based RPG which aims to help players understand the logic of entanglement event between the qubits by adding an 'entanglement' mechanic the player can use to superimpose two allied units.
It is written in Python with Pygame and uses Azure Quantum with an IonQ backend. Thanks guys!

*Description:*
--------

Quantum Emblem has gameplay very similar to classic Fire Emblem, with the inclusion of the 'entanglement' mechanic. This can be used to entangle the stats of two allied units --- attack strength, weapons, even position can be entangled! Players must get creative and adopt new strategies to win the fight.

Quantum Emblem comes with lots of cool features:

Freedom to entangle player units.
Options to tweak the code design to include more i.e higher the scores of your attributes, higher chances for you to transport!
Player created quantum circuits (not yet implemented)

*Instructions:*
------

There are two teams: Squadra Blue and Squadra Rossa:

- ![#1589F0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) `Squadra Blue` team is made up of boss, skeleton, and soldier.

- ![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) `Squadra Rossa` team is made up of pirate tux, pirate, and ninja.

Between the fights, units can “Entangle” and choose an unit they want to switch places (or stats) with. This way, they can teleport to the other units’ coordinate to survive an attack or go on the offensive!

*Our team's personal experience at MIT iQuHACK 2022:*
---------

Our team consists of five people from different backgrounds with different levels of experience in Quantum Computing. We have a high school senior, two undergrads, and two early-career professionals. iQuHack 2022 was a unique experience for all of us. While a couple of us had participated in Quantum Computing Hackathons before, others were new to the scene. We met some of our team members through Slack and others through the Gather event. Working on building a Quantum-themed game as a part of the Microsoft/Ion-Q challenge was a fun and refreshing experience for all of us. Developing and fine-tuning the idea, building the GUI, and preparing documentation all in 26 hours is a hasty and stressful process but we got to learn a lot from each other as well as the mentors.

How to play
-----------

Launch the game with

```python main.py```
